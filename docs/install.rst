Install
=======

To install ``multinorm`` use pip::

    pip install multinorm

Dependencies:

- `numpy`_
- `scipy`_
- `pandas`_ - optional, for summary tables and reports
- `matplotlib`_ - optional, for plotting

This package consists of a single Python file `multinorm.py`_.
Most users will not care about this implementation detail,
but if you'd like to copy and "vendor" it for some reason,
you can bundle a copy and avoid the extra dependency for just one file and class.
